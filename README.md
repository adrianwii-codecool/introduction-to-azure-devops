# Tutorial: Introduction to Azure DevOps

## Introduction

A deep dive into planning your software development in an agile environment.

Please get accustomed to the git branching standards which are a good starting point for structuring, 
setting-up and starting your future CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery).

## Tutorial

## 1. Git branching and naming convection
In included below lab, you will learn how to establish a local Git repository, which can easily be synchronized with a 
centralized Git repository in Azure DevOps. In addition, you will learn about Git branching and merging support. 
You will use Visual Studio Code, but the same processes apply for using any Git-compatible client with Azure DevOps.

## 2. Version controlling
This tutorial is described based on C#. You can still go through it because it focuses on integrating visual studio code 
with git, so it's easy to adapt it for JavaScript and other languages.

## 3. Agile methodology
Let's focus on how Agile planning works: from ideas to story cards.

## 4. Azure boards
You will explore the product backlog, sprint backlog, and task boards that can be used to track the flow of work during 
an iteration. Step by step guide will help you to be familiar with Azure Boards.
Before you start, please complete `Task 1` from [this site](https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/azuredevops/prereq/) (you can 
skip `Task 2`) to create a preconfigured `Parts Unlimited` team project.
